# Set

A single player Set card game, implemented based on requirements from the [Stanford CS193p courses](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/a3_2.pdf)

**This branch uses older APIs, maintains compatibilty for older OSes (iOS 15, macOS 13), might has more animation hitches.**
